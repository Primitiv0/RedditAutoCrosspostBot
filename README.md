# RedditAutoCrosspostBot
https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoCrosspostBot

This reddit bot listens to comments and looks for ones that match the pattern 

`/r/target_subreddit`

It then saves the link to that comment for later processing.
After some waiting period  (e.g. 3 months), the bot checks the same comment, and if it has accrued enough upvotes, the bot will crosspost the submission that the comment replied to, to the target subreddit.

# Known problem: Reposts
This bot has two methods for preventing reposts. It first checks whether the source submission link was already posted to the target subreddit, and then it uses [repostsleuth.com](https://www.repostsleuth.com) to check whether anything similar to that link was already posted to the target subreddit.

As far as I know, RepostSleuth doesn't support videos or any other non-image file format, so this method will fail to detect video reposts.

I am looking for a way to solve this problem. Suggestions are welcome.
