# RedditAutoCrosspostBot
https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoCrosspostBot

This reddit bot listens to comments and looks for ones that match the pattern 

`/r/target_subreddit`

It then saves the link to that comment for later processing.
After some waiting period  (e.g. 3 months), the bot checks the same comment, and if it has accrued enough upvotes, the bot will crosspost the submission that the comment replied to, to the target subreddit.

This project also shares the code for three additional bots:

## sub_doesnt_exist_bot
https://www.reddit.com/user/sub_doesnt_exist_bot

Replies to the same type of comments and informs that the sub they linked does not exist.


## same_subreddit_bot
https://www.reddit.com/user/same_subreddit_bot

Replies to comments that link to the same subreddit that comment was posted on.

## same_post_bot
https://www.reddit.com/user/same_post_bot

Replies to comments that link to a subreddit that already has a post with the same content as the source submission.

# Known problem: Reposts
This bot has two methods for preventing reposts. It first checks whether the source submission link was already posted to the target subreddit, and then it uses [repostsleuth.com](https://www.repostsleuth.com) to check whether anything similar to that link was already posted to the target subreddit.

As far as I know, RepostSleuth doesn't support videos or any other non-image file format, so this method will fail to detect video reposts.

I am looking for a way to solve this problem. Suggestions are welcome.
